# MEV-Bot

Mining Extractable Value (MEV) offers a lucrative avenue for income generation derived from unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. Leveraging the cutting-edge infrastructure of Flashbot, you can earn passive income by exploiting MEV. 

Flashbot provides miners with the power to strategically select and sequence transactions in blocks, thereby extracting additional value. This opens up profitable trades, arbitrage opportunities, and a host of MEV-related prospects. Witness your earnings skyrocket based on transactions located in the blockchain's mempool!

## üí° Introducing Flashbot

Flashbot is an open infrastructure pioneered by a team of researchers and developers to exploit Miner Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum network. It gives blockchain miners the power to gain additional value from transactions by controlling their order and inclusion in blocks.

Flashbot aims to resolve issues related to MEV, such as frontrunning (snagging transactions before their inclusion in a block), and mitigate the adverse impact on users and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.

This infrastructure empowers developers and users to send bundles of transactions directly to Ethereum miners, bypassing the standard route via transaction pools. These bundles carry information about multiple transactions that need to be executed in a specific order, providing miners the choice to include or reject these bundles according to their preferences and objectives.
